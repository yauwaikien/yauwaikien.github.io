	<h2>Blob Kiss</h2>
	<img src="images/blobkiss.png" alt="image of a blob kissing a heart">
	<p>This is a picture of a blob kissing a heart. There are many <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blob+kissing+heart&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvLc1iAf6sXxikCezpd-g7ZEnW16Dw:1641122844880&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigjc6B-5L1AhXUPH0KHQilBrAQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1041&bih=648">pictures</a> like it on the internet.
	In fact I found this one on the internet, but this one is mine (and yours too if you prefer).
	The things I like most about this blob is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is a blob</li>
			<li>There is a heart</li>
			<li>It is kissing a heart</li>
		</ul>
	<p>This is my kind of blob. It is cute. I don't know what I'm writing, this is my first "webpage" in 
	a while. Please don't judge me too hard.</p>
    <p id="testcss">This paragraph is to test ID selector for a paragraph on the page. So let's make this
	 longer so there's more of a paragraph for me to look at to see the changes that I make.</p>
